<h2>Statements and Semicolons :</h2> <h4>PHP uses semicolons to separate simple statements. A compound statement that uses
curly braces to mark a block of code, such as a conditional test or loop, does not need
 a semicolon after a closing brace. Unlike in other languages, in PHP the semicolon
 before the closing brace is not optional</h4>


 <?php
echo "Hello, world";
myFunction(40, "O'Reilly");
$a = 1;
$name = "Elphaba";
$b = $a / 25.0;
if ($a == $b) {
    echo "Rhyme? And Reason?";
}

function myFunction($num, $prokashoni) {
    // code here
} //  no semicolon required

echo "Mejbaul Mubin" //  no semicolon required before closing tag  Itâ€™s good programming practice to include optional semicolons, as they make it easier to add code later.
?>

<h2>Whitespace and Line Breaks :</h2>

<h2> Data Types :</h2> <h4>PHP provides eight types of values, or data types. Four are scalar (single-value) types: integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans. Two are compound (collection) types: arrays and objects. The remaining two are special types: resource and NULL. </h4>

<h2>Arrays</h2>
